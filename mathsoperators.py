#mathematics operations carried out by simply assigning a number/ an int to a variable and using the variable to perform the actions


a = 20
b = 10
c = 5
d = 3
e = 2

print("We're about to perform some arithmetic operations")

ready =  input("Are you ready")
print (ready)

f = a - b / c * d ** e
g = (a-b)/ c*d**e
print(g)

h = input("Enter your first number")
i = input("Enter your second number")
f = h + i 
j = int(i) + int(h)
print (f)

#The above prints out h input and i input side by side

print (j)

#While the second adds the 2 inputs

#When you dont specify data types, python concatinate when it sees addition sign
